# Differential-Gene-Expression
## Project KER Glycogen

**Critical pathways limiting glycogen repletion and performance in the horse defined by
proteomic and transcriptomic analyses**

*Objective:*  
To determine the time course of differential expression specific genes and biological pathways during
glycogen depletion and repletion in fit thoroughbred horses fed a high starch (Sweet Feed) compared to an
isocaloric low starch, high fat (Fat) diet. 

### Study design
Five Thoroughbred geldings were given 2 diets (low and high starch) with apporpriate washout periods between diet. 
Muscle biopsies were taken from the gluteal muscle at four timepoints: pre-depletion of glyogen, depletion, repletion at 24h and repletion at 72h. 

### Differential Gene Expression Analysis
Determined differentially expressed genes were identified for the following comparisons:  
* Between diets per timepoint  
* Between diets over time  
* Between timepoints per diet  
* Between timepoints per diet over time

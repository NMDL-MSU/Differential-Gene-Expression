# Differential-Gene-Expression
## Project RER Thouroghbred

**Underlying Cause for Recurrent Exertional Rhabdomyolysis**

*Hypothesis:*  
Fit Thoroughbred fillies susceptible to RER in race training have differential expression of biological pathways and genes 
involved in intramuscular Ca2+ regulation compared to fillies that are not susceptible to RER. 

### Differential Gene Expression Analysis
Determined differentially expressed genes among 15 RER and 8 control fillies.

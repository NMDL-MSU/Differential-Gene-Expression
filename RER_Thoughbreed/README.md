# Differential-Gene-Expression
## Project RER Thoroughbred

**Underlying Cause for Recurrent Exertional Rhabdomyolysis**

*Hypothesis:*  
Fit Thoroughbred fillies susceptible to RER in race training have differential expression of biological pathways and genes involved in intramuscular Ca2+ regulation compared to horses that are not susceptible to RER. 

### Differential Gene Expression Analysis
Determined differentially expressed genes among 15 RER and eight control fillies.
